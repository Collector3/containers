# containers

Various printable containers that can be used to store things. This repository contains (sorry) some of the more useful ones.

### m2.5-half-case

Half size cases with lids. These were designed to fit into the [latching 5-compartment storage boxes](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2938) that [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com/) sells.

They were originally designed for M2.5 screws, but its entirely possible that they will fit other sizes within reason.

### m2.5-case

"Full size" cases designed for independent (out of case) use. These fit Trimcraft Aviation RC's screw bags, stacked together vertically.

### cylinder

A cylinder. Comes with a screw on top. Buyer beware. This was a test to see if I could make a better pill bottle for users with reduced strength in their hands (unsuccessful, for now; at least I think so).

### screw-funnel

A funnel. Used for transferring screws. Don't over think it like I did (it works for fluids with your slicer's vase mode though).
